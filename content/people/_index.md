    <h3>Dr. Mariela Cortés López</h3>
    <p class="person-title">Principal Investigator</p>
    <p>
      I moved around continents to follow my interest in RNA biology. I did my PhD in Biology at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Mainz, there 
      I got interested in single cell biology and decided to move to NYC to study splicing using long read genomics. 
      Currently, at Helmholtz and LMU I have a special interest on translating single cell and computational methods into actionable insights for
      pediatric and young adult disease. Outside the lab, I love live music, trying to
      improve my swimming skills and I am always on the lookout for great Mexican food in Germany.
