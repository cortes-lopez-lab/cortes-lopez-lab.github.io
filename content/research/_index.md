Dissecting genetic and non-genetic roles of RNA regulation in cellular phenotypes.

The Cortés López Lab, based at the Institute of Computational Biology within the Helmholtz Munich Computational Health Center and the LMU Children's Hospital (Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital), develops computationally driven, high-resolution single cell approaches to study how RNA regulation and alternative splicing shape cellular identity in health and disease.

Integrating long-read single-cell transcriptomics, multimodal genomics, computational models, and machine learning frameworks, the lab investigates RNA dysregulation in pediatric and adult diseases, spanning cancer, developmental disorders, and non-malignant pathologies. As part of the German Center for Child and Adolescent Health (DZKJ), our goal is to develop RNA-centric, data-driven methodologies that transform mechanistic insight into precision medical interventions, with a strong focus on childhood disease.
